== OneCX Workspace UI


=== What is Workspace Management?
OneCX Workspace Management refers to the process of creating, editing, deleting
and transferring workspaces and their applications, slots and roles.


=== Overview
OneCX Workspace is a comprehensive solution for managing
workspaces in a user-friendly and efficient manner.
In this document we are only referring to the OneCX Workspace User Interface (UI) of
OneCX Workspace Management.

The UI for this Workspace Management component is designed 
to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience for managing
workspaces in the cloud-native environment built with Quarkus.


=== Getting Started
To start developing the OneCX Workspace UI, you need to
set up your local development environment. Itâ€™s recommended that you use
WSL as the runtime for your application, as shown in the figure below.
If you are using a different runtime, please check that you meet the
requirements below.

==== Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17
* Maven build tool
* Git
* Docker + Docker Compose
* Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - recommended
* NodeJS

==== Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the required repositories to your local machine using
the following command:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/onecx/onecx-workspace-ui.git
git clone https://github.com/onecx/workspace-dev.git
----

The repository `onecx-workspace` contains the source code of
the OneCX Workspace product. 
The repository `onecx-workspace-ui` contains the source code of
the OneCX Workspace UI as part of the product. 

==== Update local DNS resolution
Assuming you are using WSL, updating the local host file for local 
development allows you to map domain names to specific IP addresses,
making it easier to test and debug applications using custom domain names
instead of IP addresses. To enable multiple services on the same port,
we use traefik as a reverse proxy. A running traefik container is 
therefore essential for your local setup to route your traffic to the
appropriate Docker containers based on hostnames.

*It is recommended that the WSL host file and the Windows host file are aligned.
Unless you have disabled this behaviour, the WSL host file will be automatically
generated from the Windows host file when WSL is restarted.*

===== Update Windows host file
Open the file `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` in your favorite
editor and add the following entries:

[source,bash]
----
127.0.0.1       postgresdb
127.0.0.1       keycloak-app
127.0.0.1       traefik
127.0.0.1       onecx-workspace-ui
127.0.0.1       onecx-workspace-bff
127.0.0.1       onecx-workspace-svc
----

===== Update WSL host file
If needed, update the file `\etc\hosts` in `your` favorite linux editor and add the
same entries like above.

==== Starting OneCX dependencies
In a local development environment, Docker Compose is used to define and
manage multiple containers as a single application stack. It enables
developers to easily start, stop, and configure all the necessary
services and dependencies required by OneCX Workspace Management using a
simple configuration file.

[source,bash]
----
mkdir onecx-workspace
cd onecx-workspace
docker compose up -d traefik postgresdb pgadmin keycloak-app
----

* `traefik`: Traefik is an ingress controller for Kubernetes deployments
that enables dynamic traffic routing and load balancing based on defined
rules and configurations.
* `postgresdb`: PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database
management system. It is used as persistence layer for storing and
managing data of OneCX products, providing reliability and
scalability.
* `pgadmin`: pgAdmin is an open-source administration and development
platform that offers a user-friendly graphical interface for managing
and interacting with the local PostgreSQL database.
This is optional. 
* `keycloak`: Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management
system that simplifies authentication, authorization, and single sign-on
for web and mobile applications.
